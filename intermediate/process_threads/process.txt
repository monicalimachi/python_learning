Process: An instance of a program (eg. a Python interpreter)
+ Takes advantage of multiple CPUS and cores
+ Separate memory space ==> Memory is not shared between processes
+ Great for CPU-bound processing
+ New process is stated independently from other processes
+ Processes are interruptable / killable
+ One GIL for each process ==> avoids GIL limitation


- Heavyweight
- Starting a process is slower than starting a thread
- More memory
- IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated
